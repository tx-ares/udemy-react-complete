In redux, reducers are functions that return a single value.  In addition, they must remain pure and synchronus.  Another thing to note is that state must remain unmutated in reducer functions otherwise it would disrupt
the whole design purpose of using a reducer.  It's main function is to return a new state object to replace the current state object as the new updated state.
