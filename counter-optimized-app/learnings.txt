This project highlights performance enhancing techniques like using memo-ization.  This is a way for React to cache certain component property values to only rerender components when specific property changes happen. 
This prevents unneccessary re-renders and thus improving app performance.
MillionJS is a 3rd party library that is very useful in improving React performance.
